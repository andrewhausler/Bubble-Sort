This repository demonstrates how bubble sort works. 
There are two examples one in java and the other in python. 
The java file has a test file inside of the test directory.
Bubble sort works by an index bubbling up and rising above the array.
It then begins comparing its adjacent indexes checking if its greater than.
If so then it will swap indexes and keep going until it reaches it last index.
You can change this around and have it checking for less than as well.
